# British-Airways-Virtual-Internship

There are 2 projects in this Virtual Internship
1. Web scrapping to gain company insights
   We got the data from Skytrax website. We should analyze the data from customers review to uncover some insights using sentiment analysis or wordclouds to provide some insight into the content of the reviews.
2. Predicting customer buying behaviour
  We should train a machine learning model to be able to predict the target outcome, which is a customer making a booking. For this case we use RandomForest.
